I have used it for a client that needs visual reprensentations to where the pains are located in the body. What is your use case? This field will produce a base-64 image. If you're saving this to your table, I recommend making a `BLOB` column or convert it to an actual image file.

## Installation

You can install the package via composer:

```bash
composer require ruelluna/canvas-pointer
```


## Usage

```php
CanvasPointerField::make('body-points')
    ->pointRadius(15) // default is 5
    ->imageUrl('your image source')
    ->width(800) // required
    ->height(800) // required
    ->label('Select body parts that are in pain'),
```

## Todos
- [ ] Automatically detect height and width
- [ ] Table Column Component
- [ ] Entry Component
- [ ] `npm` Konva dependency
